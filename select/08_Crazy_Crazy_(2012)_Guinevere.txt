You started a storm
Like a pornstar, you better perform
Feeling out of control
A night in Paris, ready to go
Shut your mouth, boy
You are gonna love it
I'm feelin' freaky, boy, you know you want it
My heart is taking off, just like a rocket
So baby turn up the lights, so I can rock it
Rock it
Everytime, I think about you
I feel the shivers running up my spine
It makes me crazy
Every night
I dream about you
Feel the trigger pullin'
It's a sign
I love you, baby
Crazy, crazy
You make me crazy all the time
Baby, baby
You make me lose my fucking mind
You are mine for the kill
'Cause tonight, babe, you know it's for real
Beads of sweat dripping off of your lips
Fingertips touching, grabbing my hips
Kiss my mouth, boy
You are gonna love it
I'm feeling dirty, boy
You know you want it
My heart is sinking faster than Titanic
So baby, turn down the lights
So we can rock it
Rock it
Everytime I think about you
I feel the shivers running up my spine
It makes me crazy
Every night
I dream about you
Feel the trigger pullin'
It's a sign
I love you, baby
Crazy, crazy
You make me crazy all the time
Baby, baby
You make me lose my fucking mind
Baby, play these roles, such a thrill
Always fun, with you love, this is real
Everytime
I think about you, I feel the shivers
Running
Up my spine
It makes me crazy
Every night
I dream about you
Feel the trigger pullin'
It's a sign
I love you, baby
Crazy, crazy
You make me crazy all the time
Baby, baby
You make me lose my fucking mind

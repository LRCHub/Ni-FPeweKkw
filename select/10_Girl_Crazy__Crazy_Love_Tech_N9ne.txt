To all the girls that I loved before
I only wanna love ya more
I know it sounds shady, lady

Girl crazy, I know nobody can save me
From spreading my crazy love
I'm dipping out with your lady
To give her some crazy love

Ain't tryna have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy
'Cuz I'm all about crazy love

I was born Aaron Dantes Yates
Now this song for Aaron Dantes mates
Wait if you ever been with me
Had some sex or even kissed me

Spend some years with me or even a quickie, trip thee
Way I handle the beast In me the peace in me
And equally I chief to say
The least women are weaker then me

Since I was a little fella, witta me a female-a Isabella
What the hell not one but it's more like twelve let me tell ya
Hella, bitches love me once then love me again
While ya loving me I'm loving your friend, ya'll just loving the sin

And all that tech time you lovin' to spend
But I ain't tryna be no husband again
Look at all this mug that I'm in
And all this dirt that I do and this hurt put on you it's true

Worse them pepe la pue what it do
To my ladies I remember the message I sent to ya
I know ya think I'm a friend to ya
But I'm tryna put it up into ya

Girl crazy, I know nobody can save me
From spreading my crazy love
I'm dipping out with your lady
To give her some crazy love

Ain't tryna have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy
'Cuz I'm all about crazy love

A challenge a ghetto my uncle explained it to me
What kick it with bitches the picture that he painted for me
Now that I'm a G, I'm bout to go in to depth got low when I crept
What a bitch, you niggaz ain't no when I slept
(With who)

Sanya, Tanya, Vanya, big booty Sandra Wanda
Landa, Ronda, Manya, V-neck and Anya
Ain't just to fill the pound between us
Kiss the crown of my wiener

Once you lay down then you're stuck
With the killer clown the Nina
Witness my sickness
This itches for the bitches with the quickness

Kisses for misses is cliquish suspicious that I hit this
What they really don't know I had the most
Ludacris fling with this girl
I think the female is really the most
Beautifulest thing in this world

They take off their shirt take off their bra
Then let you take off their skirt and panties
Keep a nigger in awe
In between I'm such a freedom is loving monster sex
For them to let you inside them is a fucken compliment

Girl crazy, I know nobody can save me
From spreading my crazy love
I'm dipping out with your lady
To give her some crazy love

Ain't tryna have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy
'Cuz I'm all about crazy love

The homie for true he's sick
'Cuz he choose these chicks
On the road I let them sud mi pik
They telling me I show my wife no fidelity and lost it

Literally my way with women has cost it considerably
Bitter is he who loved then lost
With the grudge and cross the moss
In the land where the word lost is boss

So we quest for love and flings
With the finest the life can bring to ya
True, you two have a thing
But I'll never ever be singular

Guess you can say it's the angel in me
That got these bitches havin' dreams of mangling me
(I know it hurt and sucks for women
When they let me thrust within them)

Why do they lay with the snake
(But can't there stop there lust for venom
But you will not forgive me baby you gots to admit we crazy)
'Cuz you bring me your light and I'm just so ditz and hazy
My heart is massive but they want my dick
Bitch you ain't never felt no shit like this so give me a kiss

Girl crazy, I know nobody can save me
From spreading my crazy love
I'm dipping out with your lady
To give her some crazy love

Ain't tryna have no more babies
So come for my crazy love
Enough to make her go crazy
'Cuz I'm all about crazy love

Ooo, way, ya, oo, way, ya, hey, ya
Ooo, way, ya, oo, way, ya, hey, way, ya

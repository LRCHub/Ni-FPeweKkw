Shine on
All my people who've been broken hearted
Shine on
From the place where all life had been started
When you need fresh air
Go beyond horizons
To your place in the sun
Shine on
Let your heart be boundless
Like your faith in the one.

It's crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't tell me that you don't care
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
No stopping to this warfare
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
We're breathing in the same air
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't tell me that you don't care
You don't care
No stopping to this warfare
And you don't care
No

Sing on
From the language of your ancestors and
Sing on
Be playful in your innocence and
Lift your head up high
And rejoice for all you see
Without your eyes
Sing on
Like a bird that's making love in sunset skies

It's crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't tell me that you don't care
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
No stopping to this warfare
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
We're breathing in the same air
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't tell me that you don't care

No life's worth more than any other
No sister worth less than any brother
No life's worth more than any other
No sister worth less than any brother
No life's worth more than any other
No sister worth less than any brother
No life's worth more than any other
No sister worth less than any brother

It's crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't tell me that you don't care
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
No stopping to this warfare
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
We're breathing in the same air
It's crazy, crazy, crazy
Don't tell me that you don't care
You don't care
No stopping to this warfare
You don't care

Somebody, please
